This repository includes code and results used in development of a new machine learning approach to modeling salinity yield modeling for Upper Colorado River Basin. This work is currently in preparation to submit a manuscript to Water Resources Research in a paper entitled "Salinity yield modeling of the Upper Colorado River Basin using 30-meter resolution soil maps and machine learning".
